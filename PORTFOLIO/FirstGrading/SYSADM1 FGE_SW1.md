 # **Evolution of Systems Administration: From Manual to Automated**

 # **SYSADM1** 

Case study

SysPro Corporation, a mid-sized manufacturing company, began operations in the 1980s. As the company grew, so did its reliance on technology. This case study explores the evolution of SysPro Corporation, from manual operations to a highly automated environment.

SysPro Corporation was primarily focused on hardware maintenance and software installation. The system administrators were responsible for tasks such as installing operating systems, configuring applications, and troubleshooting hardware issues. They experience frequent system downtime, slow response times, and limited scalability because of outdated computing equipment. The corporation used basic scripting for repetitive tasks, but most processes were manual. However, after two years, the corporation expanded rapidly, leading to increased IT infrastructure and complexity. The implementation of a company-wide network enabled better communication and data sharing. The basic automation tools progressed to advanced to manage user accounts and software installations. Managing the growing infrastructure, security threats increased thus demanding more user support.

At present, SysPro Corporation migrated a significant portion of its infrastructure to the cloud, reducing hardware and maintenance costs. The company embraced automation and DevOps practices to improve efficiency and reliability of their day to day operations. Configuration management tools were also used to define and manage infrastructure. The stockholders also invested a lot on automated pipelines to implement software development and deployment that later on ensured data security in the cloud, managing cloud costs, and developing new skills for cloud-based operations.

**Based on the case study,** 

1.Describe the role of system administrators at SysPro Corporation in the early years. What were the primary challenges they faced?

	The system administrators of SysPro Corporation have been responsible for troubleshooting, hardware maintenance, software installation, and manually installing, configuring, and resolving hardware issues. They encountered frequent system downtime and response times because their equipment was already outdated. Since they performed manual processes, they had operational difficulties.

2. Discuss the limitations of manual system management as experienced by SysPro Corporation. How did these challenges impact the business?

	The manual processes performed had a negative effect on the business since it caused delay, reduced productivity, and higher risk of human error. The manual system management led has become ineffective as the company grows since it increases system downtime, slow responses time and becomes a time consuming task. Because of this the business becomes unsustainable and will not grow.

3. Identify the automation tools mentioned in the case study and explain their role in improving efficiency.

	The company implemented a company-wide network to enable better communication and sharing of data. It is also mentioned there that a basic automation tool led to an advanced management of user accounts and software installations.  It improved the company’s efficiency since it reduced manual processes that caused disruptions to other activities due to downtime.

4. Analyze the impact of cloud adoption and DevOps practices on SysPro Corporation's IT operations.

	By implementing the use of cloud, the company is now flexible and has a better approach when it comes to managing and securing data and also reduced the hardware and maintenance expenses. By having an automated software the DevOps increased the company’s efficiency. This modernized approach also enabled quicker responses to changes and improvements, further enhancing the company's overall performance.

5. Predict potential future trends in system administration and their implications for organizations like SysPro Corporation.

	Nowadays AI will most likely be used for everything a person can and cannot do. In terms of services, AI can provide more advanced automation and predictions. Just like the SysPro Corporation, companies and organizations should be updated and use current trends to survive in the industry.
